The stalwart of these temporary art exhibitionary spaces is the Venice Biennale (1895), which is organized by country and imbricated in late-nineteenth century and twentieth-century representations of nationhood. By the 1950s already struggling to stay current alongside the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial (1951), Biennale curators have been pushed into constant reinvention and innovation.

This course explores cultural criticism on a range of issues that examine the intersections of history, politics, media, and various crises in the 21st century by writers from a variety of backgrounds: journalists, academics, activists, artists, scientists, and politicians. We analyze how these writers use their professional expertise to craft work for the public arena, and what it means to create a history of the present.&#160;The course\u2019s four sections cover various responses to some of the issues most publicly contested across college campuses nationwide, and here at Yale: racial unrest, sexual assault, climate change, poverty, incarceration, fascism, and gun violence.</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU"], "finalExam": "0", "instructorList": ["Leah Mirakhor"], "instructorUPI": ["17378658"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["W 9.25-11.15"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["HQ 133"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": null, "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": ["AFAM398", "ER&M401"], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "Public Writing", "subjectCode": "AMST", "subjectNumber": "AMST413", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/82725/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "230", "courseTitle": "The Race Beat: Writing About Race in Politics and Policy", "crn": "15919", "department": "AMST", "description": "<p>This class focuses on the central role of race and racism in American life, exploring issues such as how racism shaped and continues to guide our immigration system, how federal housing policy created a segregated nation, and white identity politics from Nixon\u2019s Silent Majority to Trump\u2019s red hats.

How, for example, are such conventions generated and transformed where there are wide differentials of power and unequal access to resources?

How do elites\u2014ritual elders, Brahmanic priests, manorial lords, factory-managers\u2014secure compliance to a normative order? How are expressions of submission and resistance woven together in a fabric of cultural understandings?

In other words, what constitutes evidence for human evolution and how is that evidence interpreted? Students are introduced to basic milestones in human evolution and learn how they have shaped us into the species we are today, using diverse lines of evidence from evolutionary and life history theory, geochronology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, phylogenetic analysis, genetics, archaeology, and functional morphology. We critically examine key debates that have taken place over the last century of exploration in human evolutionary research, learning how unconventional thinking and spectacular discoveries have shaped current knowledge of our origins. Students meet strange and fascinating historical characters, and then meet our fossil ancestors via the cast collection. Students also receive hands-on and interactive learning about the morphology, life history patterns, locomotion, social behavior, and diet of our nearest fossil relatives; observe living primates to assess what they can tell us about our own deep past; dive into data collection by locating real archaeological and fossil sites; and learn how molecular techniques such as ancient DNA have transformed understanding of the origins of our own species.

The juxtaposition of these two worlds allows us to understand each with a fresh perspective. And this is what we study in this class: we read and interpret the best-known tragic plays by ancient playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in dialogue with key concepts of psychoanalytic criticism. Well-established questions that Greek tragedy raises about gender politics, the evolution of democracy, the progressive disintegration of the Athenian polis, the construction of citizenship and foreignness, the influence of rhetoric and sophistry is reframed in dialogue with Freud\u2019s (and his followers\u2019) redefinitions of language, the unconscious, the self, trauma, violence, and gender. The goal of this course is to provide students with a clear understanding of the historical evolutions of these two forms of cultural production while also engaging in more theoretical and comparative work of literary interpretation and critical theorization. Considering the pivotal role that both psychoanalysis and Greek tragedy held in the development of later currents of thoughts (including postcolonial studies, Black Studies, feminist theory, queer theory, and Black studies), particular attention is paid the afterlives of the Freudian method and classical tragedy.</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU", "YCWR"], "finalExam": "50", "instructorList": ["Nebojsa Todorovic"], "instructorUPI": ["17048807"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["MW 4.00-5.15"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["PH 310"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": "LITR353", "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": ["WGSS351", "HUMS375"], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "Greek Tragedy & Psychoanalysis", "subjectCode": "CLCV", "subjectNumber": "CLCV353", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/79542/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "260", "courseTitle": "Origins of Writing", "crn": "12112", "department": "CLSS", "description": "<p>Exploration of writing in the ancient Near East and the profound effects this new method of communication had on human society.

Human-generated data is being recorded at unprecedented rates and scales, and powerful AI and ML algorithms, which are capable of learning from such data, are increasingly controlling various aspects of modern society: from social interactions. These data-driven decision-making algorithms have a tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but, via the ability to mimic and nudge human behavior, they also have the potential to be discriminatory, reinforce societal prejudices, violate privacy, polarize opinions, and influence democratic processes. Thus, designing effective tools to govern modern society which reinforce its cherished values such as equity, justice, democracy, health, privacy, etc. has become paramount and requires a foundational understanding of how humans, data, and algorithms interact. This course is for students who would like to understand and address some of the key challenges and emerging topics at the aforementioned interplay between computation and society.

Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India\u2019s Independence and Partition, Seth\u2019s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother\u2019s search for a \u201csuitable boy\u201d for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom.&#160;We read&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship.

How did queer writers find an audience in the years before the emergence of a gay/lesbian public? What languages of identity and sexuality did they develop? The course begins with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, writing before the idea of sexual minorities took hold. We read some late 19C writers in their wake, including Charles Warren Stoddard, and the literary culture of the \u201cBoston marriage,\u201d before turning to the conjunction of sexual culture and modernism. Queer modernism has been much studied in recent years, including such figures as Wilde, Freud, Joyce, Woolf, Stein, Barnes, Firbank, Crane, Thurman, Hughes, and Proust; in the same years, a language of homosexual rights began to develop with such works as <em>Imre,</em> by Edward Prime Stevenson. Many of the writers in the period explored unsettled sexualities and worlds of abjection, in ways that can still disturb readers. They influenced one another across the Atlantic and across genres. We touch on the British and Irish writers who came of age after WWI (Isherwood, Auden, Spender, Ackerley, Barnes), as well as the paradigmatically queer writing of those for whom queerness was linked to a language of criminality\u2014notably Jean Genet, Patricia Highsmith, and William Burroughs. Students are encouraged to pursue research projects in each of these moments, reaching up to the Beats (Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac), the New York poets (O\u2019Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler) the San Francisco Renaissance (Spicer, Duncan, Broughton), Southern queer writers (McCullers, Capote, Williams), black queer writing after the Harlem Renaissance (Baldwin, Hansberry), and other figures of the 60s from both high literary and underground backgrounds (Nabokov, Elizabeth Bishop, Joe Orton, and Vidal, but also Jack Smith, Jane Rule, and Iceberg Slim). Along the way we talk about the various ways that these writers charted a queer take on the world, including their engagements with criminality and psychopathology\u2014the main connotations of queerness in the period\u2014as well as the development of a queer language of abjection and its advantages for life.

Our material and psychic supply chains grow tenuous. All of life changes even as we try to preserve what we deem most valuable. We must rethink what we consider to be \u201cessential.\u201d&#160;Yet this is far from being a new condition. Infectious disease has been part of the human social world probably since the beginnings of urban life. The Bible describes plagues sent by God as punishment. The earliest historical depiction was by Thucydides shortly after the plague in Athens in 430 BCE. At each occasion, people have tried to witness and to understand these \u201cvisitations,\u201d as Daniel Defoe called them. The Plague is always a medical, political, economic and an interpretive crisis. It is also a moral crisis, as people must not only try to understand but also determine how to act. This course studies accounts of pandemics, from Thucydides in Athens up to our ongoing Coronavirus outbreaks. We trace the histories of understanding that accompanied pandemics: religious, scientific, philosophical, ethical, literary. It seems to be the case that these vast, horrifying penetrations of death into the fabric of life have inspired some of our fragile and resilient species\u2019 most strange and profound meditations.<br /></p>\n<p>&#160; &#160;&#160;<br /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU", "YENJ"], "finalExam": "0", "instructorList": ["James Berger"], "instructorUPI": ["11161746"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["Th 1.30-3.20"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["BASSLB L73"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": "AMST308", "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": ["HUMS275"], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "Literatures of the Plague", "subjectCode": "ENGL", "subjectNumber": "ENGL335", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/82163/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "120", "courseTitle": "Reading and Writing the Modern Essay", "crn": "15812", "department": "ENGL", "description": "<p>Close reading of great nonfiction prepares students to develop mastery of the craft of powerful writing in the humanities and in all fields of human endeavor, within the university and beyond.

Our main object of inquiry, however, is the intellectual division that emerged between supporters and critics of the French Revolution, the historical event that prompted the modern political identities of liberalism and conservatism. Accordingly, we examine the political, moral, and economic theories of the Revolution; reactions to the Revolution from Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and other counterrevolutionaries; critical responses to their reactions, including those from Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and James Mackintosh; and the impact of this debate on the evolution of liberalism and conservatism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe and the United States.

The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking.

The fall of the communist state had an outsized effect on the Russian mediascape. The three pillars of mass media which had previously been nationalized \u2014 cinema, television, and the paper press \u2014 now had to contend with the challenges of the free market. These new economic conditions, together with technological developments and the disappearance of tight ideological control imposed by the state, led to a radical redefinition of the media industry. The Internet, which officially came to Russia in 1997, complicated the picture further. The course will be divided into four blocks--cinema, television, the Internet and theater/performance. We will trace the historical development of each, analyzing a range of key works produced during this period. Our primary focus will be on the relationship between media and ideology. We deliberately avoid referring to the period in question as post-Soviet or Putin\u2019s Russia because both of these terms come with a set of assumptions and expectations which would limit the scope of our conversation. Instead we seek to emphasize the diversity of the contemporary Russian mediascape and the ways different productions negotiated questions of gender, national identity, and politics during this period of relative ideological freedom. We conclude by examining the sudden recent conclusion of that freedom, as well as the way platforms such as YouTube and services such as VPN continue making an alternative media sphere possible for Russian speakers.

The seminar also covers anti-colonial resistance, revolutionary organizations and ideas, and processes of decolonization.&#160;</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU", "YCWR"], "finalExam": "0", "instructorList": ["Arne Westad"], "instructorUPI": ["24066793"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["Th 3.30-5.20"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["WTS A35"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": "HIST224J", "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": [], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "Empires&ImperialismSince1840", "subjectCode": "GLBL", "subjectNumber": "GLBL224", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/79308/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "499", "courseTitle": "Senior Capstone Project", "crn": "11650", "department": "GLBL", "description": "<p>Students work in small task-force groups and complete a one-term public policy project under the guidance of a faculty member.

The two-term essay takes the form of a substantial article, not longer than 12,500 words (approximately forty to fifty double-spaced typewritten pages). This is a maximum limit; there is no minimum requirement. Length will vary according to the topic and the historical techniques employed. Students writing the two-term senior essay who expect to graduate in May enroll in HIST 495 during the fall term and complete their essays in HIST 496 in the spring term. December graduates enroll in HIST 495 in the spring term and complete their essays in HIST 496 during the following fall term; students planning to begin their essay in the spring term should notify the senior essay director by early December. Each student majoring in History must present a completed Statement of Intention, signed by a department member who has agreed to serve as adviser, to the History Department Undergraduate Registrar by the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Blank statement forms are available from the History Undergraduate Registrar and in the Senior Essay handbook. Students enrolled in HIST 495 submit to the administrator in 237 HGS a two-to-three-page analysis of a single primary source, a draft bibliographic essay, and at least ten pages of the essay by the deadlines listed in the Senior Essay Handbook. Those who meet these requirements receive a temporary grade of SAT for the fall term, which will be changed to the grade received by the essay upon its completion. Failure to meet any requirement may result in the student\u2019s being asked to withdraw from HIST 495. Students enrolled in HIST 496 must submit a completed essay to 211 HGS no later than 5 p.m. on the dates indicated in the Senior Essay Handbook. Essays submitted after 5 p.m. will be considered as having been turned in on the following day. If the essay is submitted late without an excuse from the student's residential college dean, the penalty is one letter grade for the first day and one-half letter grade for each of the next two days past the deadline. No essay that would otherwise pass will be failed because it is late, but late essays will not be considered for departmental or Yale College prizes. All senior departmental essays will be judged by members of the faculty other than the adviser. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in History must achieve a passing grade on the departmental essay.</p>", "distDesg": [], "finalExam": "0", "instructorList": ["David Sorkin"], "instructorUPI": ["15300821"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["1 HTBA"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["1 HTBA"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": null, "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": [], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "The Senior Essay", "subjectCode": "HIST", "subjectNumber": "HIST496", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/79425/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "497", "courseTitle": "One-Term Senior Essay", "crn": "11825", "department": "HIST", "description": "<p>All senior History majors should attend the mandatory senior essay meeting in early September at a time and location to be announced in the online Senior Essay Handbook.</p><p>The senior essay is a required one- or two-term independent research project conducted under the guidance of a faculty adviser.

Over the course of the semester, we read a single primary text: Vikram Seth\u2019s&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;(1993). Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India\u2019s Independence and Partition, Seth\u2019s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother\u2019s search for a \u201csuitable boy\u201d for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom.&#160;We read&#160;<em>A Suitable Boy</em>&#160;as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship. Over the course of our discussions, we address the following questions: what is the relationship between the nation, the novel, and identity in the postcolonial world? How do we read narratives of \u201cnation building\u201d as literary and cultural constructions? What do we make of \u201cliterature\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d as disciplinary categories and formations?

From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events.

From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people.

After spending several weeks covering some of the canonical theorists of biopolitics, we take on a series of more recent case studies and thinkers who have addressed some of the urgent issues of our time through a critical scrutiny of the meanings of life. Topics include secularization and sovereignty, the biopolitics of race and sexuality, the precarious status of life in pandemic times, and death.

The essential claim of the Sublime, writes Thomas Weiskel, is that we can transcend the human. The etymology of the word suggests moving beyond limits. To study the Sublime, then, is to confront what it means to be human at and beyond our limits, whether those limits are constructed individually, socially, intellectually, emotionally, perceptually, or otherwise. The writers and artists we examine in this course show us that the affective registers of a confrontation with the Sublime include fear, confusion, humility, weakness, despair and (often at the same time)&#160;such opposites as courage, clarity, strength, wisdom, and ecstasy.

You will learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. You will also learn to understand, produce and evaluate a few popular genres of Digital Humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the semester, you will learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project.

Our theoretical bedrock is offered by modern and contemporary thinkers such as Fred Moten, Edouard Glissant, Eve Sedgwick, and Hannah Arendt. Our primary sources come from cultural epicenters of Renaissance, Baroque, and late Modern Italy, such as Leo X papal court, fascist Ferrara, 17th century Venice, and colonial Libya. In class, we adopt a trans-historical, intersectional, and interdisciplinary perspective inspired by current scholarship and early modern ideas of temporality, identity, and belonging.

We examine the way in which writers and artists struggled with these issues in five media: memoir, theology, history, fiction, and painting, thereby creating Jewish versions first of Enlightenment, Romanticism, and realism (1780-1870) and then of nationalism, positivism, and modernism (1870-1930). &#160;</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU", "YCWR"], "finalExam": "37", "instructorList": ["David Sorkin"], "instructorUPI": ["15300821"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["MW 2.30-3.20"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["HQ 207"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": "HIST249", "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": [], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "Making European Culture Jewish", "subjectCode": "JDST", "subjectNumber": "JDST346", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/79293/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "270", "courseTitle": "Medieval Jews, Christians, and Muslims In Conversation", "crn": "10416", "department": "JDST", "description": "<p>How members of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities thought of and interacted with members of the other two cultures during the Middle Ages.

Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources. Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that restrict access of excluded persons to natural resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts students will investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are social borders and what are the processes through which they perdure? How do the effects of local practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? How does globalization change discourse about borders?

Language is common to all societies and is typically acquired without explicit instruction. Human languages vary within highly specific parameters. The conventions of speech communities exhibit variation and change over time within the confines of universal grammar, part of our biological endowment. The properties of universal grammar are discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages and comparison across languages. This course introduces analytical methods that are used to understand this fundamental aspect of human knowledge.

Our theoretical bedrock is offered by modern and contemporary thinkers such as Fred Moten, Edouard Glissant, Eve Sedgwick, and Hannah Arendt. Our primary sources come from cultural epicenters of Renaissance, Baroque, and late Modern Italy, such as Leo X papal court, fascist Ferrara, 17th century Venice, and colonial Libya.

The ideals of our political order point to a number of philosophic questions: What is freedom? What is equality? What is a free regime? Is a democracy necessarily a free regime? Is a liberal regime necessarily democratic?&#160;This course investigates such questions through a close reading of the works of two of the greatest minds of the 18th century, Montesquieu and J.J. Rousseau. These two French philosophers had a hand in shaping modernity and in transforming a Europe of feudal monarchies into a landscape of national republics.

The fall of the communist state had an outsized effect on the Russian mediascape. The three pillars of mass media which had previously been nationalized \u2014 cinema, television, and the paper press \u2014 now had to contend with the challenges of the free market. These new economic conditions, together with technological developments and the disappearance of tight ideological control imposed by the state, led to a radical redefinition of the media industry. The Internet, which officially came to Russia in 1997, complicated the picture further. The course will be divided into four blocks--cinema, television, the Internet and theater/performance. We will trace the historical development of each, analyzing a range of key works produced during this period. Our primary focus will be on the relationship between media and ideology. We deliberately avoid referring to the period in question as post-Soviet or Putin\u2019s Russia because both of these terms come with a set of assumptions and expectations which would limit the scope of our conversation. Instead we seek to emphasize the diversity of the contemporary Russian mediascape and the ways different productions negotiated questions of gender, national identity, and politics during this period of relative ideological freedom. We conclude by examining the sudden recent conclusion of that freedom, as well as the way platforms such as YouTube and services such as VPN continue making an alternative media sphere possible for Russian speakers.

The fall of the communist state had an outsized effect on the Russian mediascape. The three pillars of mass media which had previously been nationalized \u2014 cinema, television, and the paper press \u2014 now had to contend with the challenges of the free market. These new economic conditions, together with technological developments and the disappearance of tight ideological control imposed by the state, led to a radical redefinition of the media industry. The Internet, which officially came to Russia in 1997, complicated the picture further. The course will be divided into four blocks--cinema, television, the Internet and theater/performance. We will trace the historical development of each, analyzing a range of key works produced during this period. Our primary focus will be on the relationship between media and ideology. We deliberately avoid referring to the period in question as post-Soviet or Putin\u2019s Russia because both of these terms come with a set of assumptions and expectations which would limit the scope of our conversation. Instead we seek to emphasize the diversity of the contemporary Russian mediascape and the ways different productions negotiated questions of gender, national identity, and politics during this period of relative ideological freedom. We conclude by examining the sudden recent conclusion of that freedom, as well as the way platforms such as YouTube and services such as VPN continue making an alternative media sphere possible for Russian speakers.

Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources. Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that restrict access of excluded persons to natural resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts students will investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are social borders and what are the processes through which they perdure? How do the effects of local practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? How does globalization change discourse about borders?

Topics include Philosophy of liberation (Dussel), Theology of liberation (the 1968 Council of Bishops in Medellin, Colombia), Theater of the oppressed (Boal), Pedagogy of the oppressed (Freire), Cinema of liberation (manifestos of Third Cinema), the New Song protest movements across the region (both Spanish and Portuguese American music), anti-colonialism in the Caribbean (C\u00e9saire, Fanon), anti-neocolonialism (dependency theory, internal colonialism), Indigenous liberation (from the Barbados declarations to the Lacandon jungle declarations), experimental \u201cboom\u201d literature (Cort\u00e1zar) etc.</p>", "distDesg": ["YCHU"], "finalExam": "50", "instructorList": ["Moira Fradinger"], "instructorUPI": ["10154394"], "meetingEndTimeList": [], "meetingPattern": ["W 7.00-8.50p"], "meetingPatternLocation": ["WTS A74"], "meetingStartTimeList": [], "prerequisites": null, "primXLst": "LITR431", "schoolCode": "YC", "schoolDescription": "Yale College", "scndXLst": ["HUMS229", "LAST431"], "sectionNumber": "01", "sectionStatus": "A", "session": null, "shortTitle": "The Latin American Sixties", "subjectCode": "SPAN", "subjectNumber": "SPAN431", "syllabusLink": "https://yale.instructure.com/courses/79549/assignments/syllabus", "termCode": "202203"}, {"cSectionStatus": "A", "courseNumber": "120", "courseTitle": "Elementary Spanish II", "crn": "12015", "department": "SP&P", "description": "<p>Further development of understanding, speaking, reading, and writing skills.

In this course you will be introduced to the broad field of Digital Humanities, theory and practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres of scholarly and humanistic production and reproduction in the 21st century. The course combines a seminar, preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital studio. Every week we will move through our discussions in tandem with hands-on exercises that will serve to illuminate our readings and help you gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities scholarship. You will learn about the basics of plain text, file and operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. You will also learn to understand, produce and evaluate a few popular genres of Digital Humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps. Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the semester, you will learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project.

How did queer writers find an audience in the years before the emergence of a gay/lesbian public? What languages of identity and sexuality did they develop?

We read some late 19C writers in their wake, including Charles Warren Stoddard, and the literary culture of the \u201cBoston marriage,\u201d before turning to the conjunction of sexual culture and modernism. Queer modernism has been much studied in recent years, including such figures as Wilde, Freud, Joyce, Woolf, Stein, Barnes, Firbank, Crane, Thurman, Hughes, and Proust; in the same years, a language of homosexual rights began to develop with such works as <em>Imre,</em> by Edward Prime Stevenson. Many of the writers in the period explored unsettled sexualities and worlds of abjection, in ways that can still disturb readers. They influenced one another across the Atlantic and across genres. We touch on the British and Irish writers who came of age after WWI (Isherwood, Auden, Spender, Ackerley, Barnes), as well as the paradigmatically queer writing of those for whom queerness was linked to a language of criminality\u2014notably Jean Genet, Patricia Highsmith, and William Burroughs.

Our theoretical bedrock is offered by modern and contemporary thinkers such as Fred Moten, Edouard Glissant, Eve Sedgwick, and Hannah Arendt. Our primary sources come from cultural epicenters of Renaissance, Baroque, and late Modern Italy, such as Leo X papal court, fascist Ferrara, 17th century Venice, and colonial Libya. In class, we adopt a trans-historical, intersectional, and interdisciplinary perspective inspired by current scholarship and early modern ideas of temporality, identity, and belonging.
