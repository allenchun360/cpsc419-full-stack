Allen worked on regapp.py, getting the webapplication to render different html
pages and call functions from database.py to access the database. He also worked
on runserver.py to check for proper command line arguments and to run the
application on the provided server. He designed the formatted HTML pages. He
also created a course class in course.py using object oriented programming.
He debugged the code based on the results from the provided test cases.

We worked on every part of the pset together. 

We didn't receive help from anybody.

We referenced the PennyFlaskJinja code from the examples shown in class and listed 
under canvas files.

Estimated time spent on pset: 15 hours

This assignment helped us get familiar with using flask, designing html pages with
jinja2 syntax, and operating cookies. It would have been helpful to receive faster 
responses on Ed regarding the pset. It also would have been better if the autograder
was more easily accessible and released much earlier in advannce before the deadline.

For Pylint, with runserver.py, we could not resolve the general exceptions error
because we did not know what specific error to use for giving a positive integer
value for the port number. We also used a general exception to catch any other
errors that could have come up.
