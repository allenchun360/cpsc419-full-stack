Introduction to Latin American Studies: History, Culture and Society

descrip

<p>What is Latin America? The large area we refer to as Latin America is not    
unified by a single language, history, religion, or type of government. Nor is  
it unified by a shared geography or by the prevalence of a common language or   
ethnic group. Yet Latin America does, obviously, exist. It is a region forged   
from the merging of diverse cultures, historical experiences, and processes of  
resistance. This course provides an overview of Latin America and the Caribbean 
from the 16th century up to the present. While the class aims to provide        
students with an understanding of the region, due to time constraints, it       
focuses primarily on the experiences and histories of selected countries. The   
course introduces students to some of the most important debates about the      
regionâ€™s history, politics, society, and culture. The course follows a          
chronological structure while also highlighting thematic questions. Drawing on  
academic readings, films, music, art, literature, testimony, oral histories, and
writings from local voices the class explores the political transformation of   
the region, as well as topics related to ethnic and racial identity, revolution,
social movements, religion, violence, military rule, democracy, transition to   
democracy, and migration.&#160;</p>
