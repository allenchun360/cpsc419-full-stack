Family Narratives/Cultural Shifts

descrip

<p>This course looks at films that are redefining ideas around family and family
narratives in relation to larger social movements. We focus on personal films by
filmmakers who consider themselves artists, activists, or agents of change but  
are united in their use of the nonfiction format to speak truth to power. In    
different ways, these films use media to build community and build family and   
ultimately, to build family albums and archives that future generations can use 
to build their own practices. Just as the family album seeks to unite people    
across time, space, and difference, the films and texts explored in this course 
are also journeys that culminate in linkages, helping us understand nuances of  
identity while illuminating personal relationships to larger cultural, social,  
and historical movements.</p>
