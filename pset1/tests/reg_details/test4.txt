Why the Sublime? Or, The Meaning and Value of Transcendence through Theory,     
Poetry, and Art                                                                 

descrip

<p>Have you ever experienced something so powerful you couldnâ€™t possibly        
describe it? Have you ever felt both strongly attracted to and repulsed by      
something in a way that defied all logic?&#160;This course explores the role,   
structure, and value of the Sublime as an essential mode of human experience    
through a variety of theoretical writings, poetic expressions, and artistic     
outputs, in order to think through not only what the Sublime is but also why we 
need it. The essential claim of the Sublime, writes Thomas Weiskel, is that we  
can transcend the human. The etymology of the word suggests moving beyond       
limits. To study the Sublime, then, is to confront what it means to be human at 
and beyond our limits, whether those limits are constructed individually,       
socially, intellectually, emotionally, perceptually, or otherwise. The writers  
and artists we examine in this course show us that the affective registers of a 
confrontation with the Sublime include fear, confusion, humility, weakness,     
despair and (often at the same time)&#160;such opposites as courage, clarity,   
strength, wisdom, and ecstasy. Together we interrogative the conditions and     
significance of all of these Sublime feelings, and then take what we learn and  
attempt to investigate the role of the Sublime in our contemporary moment, and  
through our own personal experience.</p>
