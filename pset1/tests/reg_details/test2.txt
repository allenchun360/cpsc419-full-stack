Full Stack Web Programming

descrip                                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>This course introduces students to a variety of advanced software engineering
and programming techniques in the context of full-stack web programming. The    
focus of the course includes both client- and server-side programming (and      
database programming), client/server communication, user interface programming, 
and parallel programming. This course is designed for students who have taken   
CPSC 223 (but do not need CPSC 323 or higher-level computer science systems     
courses) and wish to learn the complete programming framework of Web            
programming. For a systematic treatment of core software engineering techniques,
using Web programming as a running example framework, consider taking CPSC 439, 
which targets students with more extensive programming experiences (after CPSC  
323).</p>
