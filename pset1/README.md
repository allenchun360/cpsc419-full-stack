Allen worked on getting the help statements from parse arg running. He also worked on header, lines_for_row, and str in table.py and implemented all three types of formatting. He came up with query statements for retrieving data from the database in reg.py and regdetails.py. He also worked on passing all the test cases in github as well as formatting the code for pylint.

We worked on every part of the pset together.


We received help from TAs during office hours.

We looked at the SQL documentation for reference.

Estimated time spent on pset: 16 hours

This assignment helped us get familiar with using SQL queries to access databases. However, learning how the formatting in table.py worked seemed unnecessary and could have been explained a lot better in the spec.
