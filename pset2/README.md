Allen worked on getting the help statements from parse arg running. He also worked on the GUI part of the pset as well as connecting the widgets with functions that connected to and sent data to the server as well as receiving table information from the server and displaying it in the windows. He also worked on regserver including connecting with the client as well as fixing the query statements in order to display every single class with a unique crn.

We worked on every part of the pset together.

We didn't receive help from anybody.

We looked at the Pyside6/PyQt5 documentation for reference. We used server client code from the examples shown in class and listed under canvas files.

Estimated time spent on pset: 10 hours

This assignment helped us get familiar with using widgets from PySide6 as well as how to use sockets to connect clients and servers to access databases. The spec felt a little too long and could have been more "to the point" and clearer.

For Pylint, with reg.py, we had No name/module errors for Pyside6, an import dialog error, and redefining built-in exit that we could not resolve because we needed all of these imports. For regserver.py, we also had a import table error that we could not resolve because we needed table.py.
